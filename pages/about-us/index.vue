              BUROOJ AIR Group developed fast and became a service partner
              offering service operations for the offshore- and land based
              industry and real estate, focusing on professional cleaning and
              surface treatment.

            <p>
              With the founding of the new brand BUROOJ AIR Working Drone in
              2022; BUROOJ AIR Working Drone is the first company to properly
              commercialise the use of drones in a variety of industries.
            </p>

            <p>
              Several years have been spent developing equipment, systems and
              procedures to better be able to service customers in countries all
              over the world with a unified safer approach.
            </p>

              R & D has always been a central part of the company, and the R & D
              work will continue together with our partners. Our partners are
              important for the further development of BUROOJ AIR Working Drone,
              and through transfer of experience we’ll all learn from each
              other.
            </p>

              <p>
                BUROOJ AIR Working Drone originated from an idea to find an
                innovative and efficient way to clean facades and windows. This
                was back in 2015. A lot of mods were needed to make the drone
                work properly for cleaning, also commercial. Fast forward the
                result is a unique drone with tailor-made and uniquely adapted
                mounting equipment with specially designed cleaning equipment. A
                patent pending safety solution to prevent the drone from falling
                down during operation is also developed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The drone has been extensively tested and commercialized for
                window and facade cleaning, and has been used operationally
                since 2020 by the BUROOJ AIR Group in Norway.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2022, BUROOJ AIR Working Drone was ready and the
                commercialising process started. Today BUROOJ AIR Working Drone
                is established almost all over the world, and the partner
                network is growing rapidly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The future holds many opportunities for development for BUROOJ
                AIR Working Drone. We think our drones soon will be able to do
                small repairs, special inspections and even surface treatment.
