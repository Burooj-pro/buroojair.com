                Burooj Air is a drone company based in the Kingdom of Saudi
                Arabia that specializes in developing and deploying drones for a
                variety of industrial and commercial applications. The company’s
                drones can perform a wide range of tasks, including:
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Cleaning Buildings: Burooj Air’s drones can be used to clean the
              exterior of buildings, removing dirt, and dust. This can save
              businesses and organizations a significant amount of time and
              money, as it eliminates the need for traditional methods of
              cleaning, such as scaffolding and manual labor.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weightlifting: Burooj Air’s drones can be used to lift and
              transport heavy objects up to 50 kg, such as construction
              materials or medical supplies. This can be a valuable tool for
              businesses and organizations that need to move heavy objects
              quickly and efficiently.
            </p>

            <p>
              Heat Measurement & Fire Fighting: Drones from Burooj Air can
              measure heat signatures, identify potential fire hazards, or
              monitor industrial equipment temperatures. As a result, accidents
              can be prevented. Furthermore, it can be equipped with fire
              suppression systems to reach hard-to-reach places. Firefighters
              can use it to fight fires more effectively & safely.
            </p>

            <p>
              Camera Filming: Burooj Air’s drones can be equipped with cameras,
              which can be used to film events or to capture aerial footage.
              This can be a valuable tool for businesses and organizations that
              need to record footage from a bird’s-eye view.

                  >BUROOJ AIR Working Drone evolved out of the BUROOJ AIR Group
                  which was founded in 1992 by Kennet Nilsen. BUROOJ AIR Group
                  have more than 30 years experience with facade and window
                  cleaning and are experts in their field.</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                BUROOJ AIR Working Drone originated from an idea to find an
                innovative and efficient way to clean facades and windows. A lot
                of mods were needed to make the drone work properly for
                cleaning, also commercial. Fast forward the result is a unique
                drone with tailor-made and uniquely adapted mounting equipment
                with specially designed cleaning equipment. A patent pending
                safety solution to prevent the drone from falling down during
                operation is also developed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The drone has been extensively tested and commercialized for
                window and facade cleaning, and has been used operationally
                since 2020 by the BUROOJ AIR Group in Norway.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2022, BUROOJ AIR Working Drone was ready and the
                commercialising process started. Today BUROOJ AIR Working Drone
                is established almost all over the world, and the partner
                network is growing rapidly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The future holds many opportunities for development for BUROOJ
                AIR Working Drone. We think our drones soon will be able to do
                small repairs, special inspections and even surface treatment.
