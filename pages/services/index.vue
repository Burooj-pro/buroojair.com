                scaffolding implemented or the use of boom and/or other lifting
                equipment. It has been said that high rise window cleaning is
                one of the six most dangerous professions. Furthermore due to

              With the innovation of BUROOJ AIR Working Drone and the
              development of this solution using drones eliminates the need for
              abseilers with rope access and skylifts making it a safer, more
              efficient and cost effective solution than the tradition methods
            </p>
            <p><b>A MORE EFFICIENT, SAFER AND COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION</b></p>
            <p>
              BUROOJ AIR Working Drone are now being implemented commercially
              globally&nbsp; for window and facade cleaning and currently are in
              development to evolve the solutions to painting with drones in the
              coming months.
            </p>
            <p>
              For now we have commercialised the use for&nbsp; window cleaning
              where&nbsp; it can achieve up to 1500 square meters per hour
              utilising the BUROOJ AIR Working Drone eco friendly (when mixed
              with 75% water) solution SelfCleaner. It can also be used with a
              full eco-friendly solution of pure water of up to 500square meters
              per hour.
            </p>
            <p>
              BUROOJ AIR Working Drone is in further development to achieve
              heights of beyond 100m+ and give capacity to massive 600 meters in
              elevation&nbsp;

                If the facade is traditionally dirty the drone applies a
                solution SelfCleaner by foaming it onto the facade with low
                pressure. The SelfCleaner agent is a special formulated cleaner
                that was developed and used by our parent company
                BUROOJ AIR Group. If the buildings haven’t been cleaned and/or
                are extremely dirty the process is to clean the facade and
                windows with the clean-watern method.<br /><br />

              <li aria-level="1">
                &nbsp;The clean-water method is in short, purified water with
                reverse osmosis, heated to 70 degrees, and applied with high
                pressure by the&nbsp; BUROOJ AIR Working Drone. This means the
                cleaning of windows is eco-friendly being <b><i>cleaned</i></b>
                <b><i>without chemicals </i></b>and windows stay cleaner over
                time. It also eliminates the risk of surface wear such as
                streaks caused by the more traditional , more dangerous manual
                cleaning methods.

                  have experience with facade and window
                  cleaning and are experts in their field.</strong

              </p>
              <p>
                BUROOJ AIR Working Drone originated from an idea to find an
                innovative and efficient way to clean facades and windows. A lot of mods were needed to make the drone
                work properly for cleaning, also commercial. Fast forward the
                result is a unique drone with tailor-made and uniquely adapted
                mounting equipment with specially designed cleaning equipment. A
                patent pending safety solution to prevent the drone from falling
                down during operation is also developed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The drone has been extensively tested and commercialized for
                window and facade cleaning, and has been used operationally
                since 2020 by the BUROOJ AIR Group in Norway.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2022, BUROOJ AIR Working Drone was ready and the
                commercialising process started. Today BUROOJ AIR Working Drone
                is established almost all over the world, and the partner
                network is growing rapidly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The future holds many opportunities for development for BUROOJ
                AIR Working Drone. We think our drones soon will be able to do
                small repairs, special inspections and even surface treatment.
