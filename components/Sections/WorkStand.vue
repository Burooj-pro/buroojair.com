					<p class="text-lg font-semibold">BUROOJ AIR Working Drone evolved out of BUROOJ AIR Group. BUROOJ AIR Group was founded in 1992 by Kennet Nilsen. BUROOJ AIR Group have more than 30 years experience with facade and window cleaning and are experts in their field.</p>
					<p>
						BUROOJ AIR Working Drone originated from an idea to find an innovative and efficient way to clean facades and windows. This was back in 2015. A lot of mods were needed to make the drone work properly for cleaning, also commercial. Fast forward the result is a unique drone with tailor-made and uniquely adapted mounting equipment with specially designed cleaning equipment. A patent pending safety solution to prevent the drone from falling down during operation is also
						developed.
					</p>
					<p>The drone has been extensively tested and commercialised for use with window and facade cleaning and has been used operationally since 2020 by the BUROOJ AIR Group in Norway.</p>
					<p>In 2022, BUROOJ AIR Working Drone was ready and the commercialising process started. Today BUROOJ AIR Working Drone is established almost all over the world, and the partner network is growing rapidly.</p>
					<p>The future holds many opportunities for development for BUROOJ AIR Working Drone. We think our drones soon will be able to do small repairs, special inspections and even surface treatment.</p>
